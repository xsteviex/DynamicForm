# Dynamic HTML Form
The Dynamic HTML Form makes creating Html forms via JavaScript easier (to me). It allows the developer to listen for specific events, easily attach event listeners and easily setup rules for validation such as required and acceptable values.

## Requirements
* Bootstrap stylesheet

## Features
* Events (utilizing observer pattern)
* EventListener Support
* Validation
